# Thanks for reaching out
Probably you have received this link because you reached out to connect to me on Linked-In. 
Probably I took forever to accept, sorry. Linked-In doesn't make it easy (FIFO queues banned there). 
One guy forgot he reached out to me once, and accused me of spamming him.
The conversation went downhill from there. 
We are off to a better start. 

Anyhow, here's how I can *maybe* help you.  

### If you are looking for a summer intership
- Apply through this [form](https://gsmc.breezy.hr/p/0db8f9750059-summer-research-internship)
- The task will involve mix of writing Python programs and deep research into the world economy.
- Location is on site in Darien CT right by the station.
- Nice place btw. Close to the water and doesn't smell like piss (but you can still go out in NYC in the evenings if you want).  
  
### If you are looking for my code, papers, articles ...
- My niche open-source Python packages are [here](https://github.com/microprediction). The focus is on timeseries, optimization, order statistics and portfolio construction. 
- Papers, articles, blogs etc are listed on my [home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home) including [Schur Portfolio Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05807). 
- I maintain a [reading list](https://github.com/microprediction/precise/blob/main/LITERATURE.md) on robust portfolio theory.
- My [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) fortells the rise of prediction networks. Audio for chapter one [here](https://github.com/microprediction/building_an_open_ai_network/blob/main/docs/assets/audio/Microprediction_Chapter_1.mp3) and see also [awards](https://microprediction.github.io/building_an_open_ai_network/feedback.html).

### If you are looking for a project to work on ...
I've been long LLMs for a while (see this [essay](https://medium.com/the-modern-scientist/remind-me-again-why-large-language-models-cant-think-acab12da63de)) and I design systems to maximize the use of their weak generalized intelligence. If you have ideas, again I'd point you to the play-money [economic prediction markets](https://manifold.markets/MikhailTal?tab=questions) so you can test your theories longitudinally. If you have a burning desire to rewrite one of my Python packages in rust, I'd love that. 

### Can you help me?    
- Constructive feedback on my various writings are invariably greeted warmly (see my [home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home)).
- Ah forget that. I really just want effusive unconditionally positive 5-star reviews for my [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network/dp/0262047322).
- Introductions to *active* mid-stage investors are appreciated.
