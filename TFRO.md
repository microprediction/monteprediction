# Thanks for reaching out
Probably you have received this link because you reached out to connect to me on Linked-In. 
Probably I took forever to accept, sorry. Linked-In doesn't make it easy (FIFO queues banned there). 
One guy forgot he reached out to me once, and accused me of spamming him.
The conversation went downhill from there. 
We are off to a better start. 

Anyhow, here's how I can *maybe* help you.  

### If you are looking for a summer intership on-site in Darien CT 2026 ([post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_economics-technology-activity-7417757645048205312-Xa9o?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAADG4ccBwZe8-bPaT745XJ5TgO3D-0a4TYo))
- Apply through this [form](https://gsmc.breezy.hr/p/0db8f9750059-summer-research-internship)

The task will involve mix of writing Python programs and deep research into the world economy. Nice place btw. Close to the water and doesn't smell like piss (but you can still go out in NYC in the evenings if you want).

  
### If you are looking for my code, papers, articles ...
- My niche open-source Python packages are [here](https://github.com/microprediction). The focus is on timeseries, optimization, order statistics and portfolio construction.
- If you are of the view that novel algorithms are all that matter and the rest is mostly noise, I'll send you straight to my [Schur Portfolio Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05807) work that unifies
  the two sides of portfolio theory, or to my work
  [here](https://github.com/microprediction/winning/blob/main/docs/Horse_Race_Problem__SIAM_updated.pdf) that made Thurstone models useful again.
- Other papers, articles, blogs etc are listed on my [home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home). 
- I maintain a [reading list](https://github.com/microprediction/precise/blob/main/LITERATURE.md) on robust portfolio theory.
- My [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) fortells the rise of prediction networks. Audio for chapter one [here](https://github.com/microprediction/building_an_open_ai_network/blob/main/docs/assets/audio/Microprediction_Chapter_1.mp3) and see also [awards](https://microprediction.github.io/building_an_open_ai_network/feedback.html).

### If you are looking for a project to work on to impress future employers ...
Ken Griffin publically admits he can't figure out how to make LLMs useful in the alpha generation process. So look, if you can, I'd suggest that's not a waste of time. 

- Ken's wrong. I've been long LLMs for a while (see this [essay](https://medium.com/the-modern-scientist/remind-me-again-why-large-language-models-cant-think-acab12da63de)) and I design systems to maximize the use of their weak generalized intelligence. It's tricky but so is everything of value.  
- If you have ideas, again I'd point you to the play-money [economic prediction markets](https://manifold.markets/MikhailTal?tab=questions) so you can test your theories longitudinally. Perhaps [manifoldbot](https://github.com/microprediction/manifoldbot) is a start but you can do much better. 

Alternatively:
  - If you have a burning desire to rewrite one of my Python packages in rust, I'd love that. 
  - Contribs to my other packages are also welcome (see [home page](https://github.com/microprediction) but also [skfolio schur](https://skfolio.org/auto_examples/clustering/plot_6_schur.html).  

### If you are looking for general advice ...
The answer to "any advice you could give me would be appreciated" is
- Learn math
- Don't work for jerks

### Can you help me?    
- Constructive feedback on my various writings are invariably greeted warmly (see my [home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home)).
- Ah forget that. I really just want effusive unconditionally positive 5-star reviews for my [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network/dp/0262047322).
- Introductions to *active* mid-stage investors are appreciated.
