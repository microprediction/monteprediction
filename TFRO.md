# Thanks for reaching out stranger

This is my current "hey nice to connect on Linked-In" page where I try to save both of us time. 

Profuse apologies if I flicked this to you absent mindedly while watching Gossip Girl with my daughter and we actually know each other! 

## Ways I can help you if you have twenty bucks or less

I've written:

- A fun eleven-dimensional [game](https://github.com/microprediction/monteprediction_colab_examples/blob/main/monteprediction_entry.ipynb) you can play immediately. 
- A [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network) about AI futurism that doesn't treat the reader like an idiot. 
- Free open-source software ... see [here](https://github.com/microprediction)
- Various [papers](https://github.com/microprediction/home) articles and provocations. 

You are welcome. 

## Ways I can help you if you are a broker or market data provider
... and want to create incredibly high quality enhanced data feeds (for trading etc) that can be sold to your customers *and* you are willing to profit share. 

- I have 6,000 data scientists including 600 PhD's around the globe who can be lazer targetted on enterprise data enhancement through a novel, layered decentralized machine whose last layer contains thousands of algorithms looking for any deviation from martingality. If that doesn't make sense read my book backwards from Chapter 8. 

I built the industry's first real-time "mid" for credit (Benchmark Solutions); algos for J.P. Morgan and other things, but there's a much better way now. 
 
## Ways I can help you if you want a job

If you are good enough, you won't need one. 

- I created [www.monteprediction.com](https://www.monteprediction.com/) as a way for people to prove themselves.
- I also suggest [www.cruchdao.com](https://www.crunchdao.com) because unlike Kaggle it is also being hooked into legit ongoing scalable financial problems.
- I try to dump job postings in the microprediction slack (bottom of page [here](https://www.monteprediction.com/) ).

If you want career advice from me, which is probably worth very little, ask ChatGPT instead and just include my writing in your RAG. Also tell it that *one should never, ever try to predict that something you learn *won't* be useful. That's really the only advice I have, but there are several corollaries that will be obvious to ChatGPT. Namely, one should learn the key ideas from all 500 mathematical subject areas. Same for computer science etc.   

## Ways I can help you if you want to schedule a chat 

Rarely will I accept. I would point out that scheduled interruptions to work are interruptions nonetheless. I politely suggest asynchronous communication via the above channels such as the Microprediction Slack, Crunch Discord, Linked-In etc. 


## Ways you can help me by not helping me 

- Not asking me if I've considered using AI in my business. 
- Not asking me if I need consultants.
- Not forcing me to very graciously decline your kind offer to discuss my org chart in great detail with you. 
- Not inviting me to help you learn about my business in any other way so you can sell me crap.
- Never, ever, reaching out to me with a pitch that begins with a declarative statement like "Firms are doing blah blah blah". This will make me want to strangle you. 
- Not offering a limited time trial of anything at all, ever. 
  
## Ways you can help me if you have capital *and are actively investing* in early-to-mid stage

Well yes, that is relevant.
