# Thanks for reaching out
Here's how I can *maybe* help. 

### If you are looking for a summer intership

- My firm is looking for interns     
- Apply through this [form](https://gsmc.breezy.hr/p/0db8f9750059-summer-research-internship)
- The task will involve mix of writing Python programs and deep research into the world economy.
- Location is on site in Darien CT
  

### If you are looking for my code, papers, articles ...
- My niche open-source Python packages are [here](https://github.com/microprediction). The focus is on timeseries, optimization, order statistics and portfolio construction. 
- Papers, articles, blogs etc are listed on my [home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home) including [Schur Portfolio Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05807). 
- I maintain a [reading list](https://github.com/microprediction/precise/blob/main/LITERATURE.md) on robust portfolio theory.
- My [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) fortells the rise of prediction networks. Audio for chapter one [here](https://github.com/microprediction/building_an_open_ai_network/blob/main/docs/assets/audio/Microprediction_Chapter_1.mp3) and see also [awards](https://microprediction.github.io/building_an_open_ai_network/feedback.html).

### If you are looking for a project to work on ...
I've been long LLMs for a while (see this [essay](https://medium.com/the-modern-scientist/remind-me-again-why-large-language-models-cant-think-acab12da63de)) and I design systems to maximize the use of their weak generalized intelligence. If you have ideas, again I'd point you to the play-money [economic prediction markets](https://manifold.markets/MikhailTal?tab=questions) so you can test your theories longitudinally.

### Are you hiring? 
Yes I'm hiring full stack developers. You can send resumes to my gsmc.ai address that you can guess. It contains my first name, last name and a period. 

### Questions I am unlikely to answer
You can help me by...
- Not asking me if I've considered using AI in my business. 
- Not asking me if I need consultants.
- Not replying to the link I sent you with "what is this link?".  It's a link.
- Not telling me you'd be interested in receiving a bespoke open ended essay from me on my experiences.  
- Not forcing me to very graciously decline your kind offer to discuss my org chart in great detail with a complete stranger. 
- Not reaching out to me with a pitch that begins with a declarative statement like "Firms are doing blah blah blah" or "Companies are finding that ...". This will make me want to strangle you. 
- Not offering a limited time trial of anything at all, ever. 

### Can you help me?   
As noted you may already be improving my feed. Thanks. Should you feel more generous: 

- Constructive feedback on my various writings are invariably greeted warmly (see my [home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home)).
- Ah forget that. I really just want effusive unconditionally positive 5-star reviews for my [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network/dp/0262047322).
- Introductions to *active* mid-stage investors are appreciated
