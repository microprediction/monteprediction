# Thanks for reaching out, stranger
This is my current "hey nice to connect on Linked-In" page. I list only highly specific ways I might help.  

### If you are looking for free stuff
or almost free

- Free open-source software ... see [here](https://github.com/microprediction)
- Papers, articles, blogs etc are listed on my [home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home)
- A [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) on prediction networks. Audio for chapter one [here](https://github.com/microprediction/building_an_open_ai_network/blob/main/docs/assets/audio/Microprediction_Chapter_1.mp3).

### If you trade OTC, 

I create uniquely useful feeds for algo trading, using ideas and algorithms from 7000 quants around the world. 
 
### If you review algo models
I can help you use the world's largest stock-pile of algorithms for detecting small departures from martingality. 

### If you rely on realtime operational predictions
Ditto 

### If you are a discretionary PM looking for new angles
See [https://pi.crunchdao.com/](https://pi.crunchdao.com/) and watch that space. 

### If you are a central bank watcher 
Again, see [https://pi.crunchdao.com/](https://pi.crunchdao.com/) where you can quickly test your hunches. It will expand soon.

### If you are interested in persuing a microprediction strategy at your firm
You should. It is a lot easier than it was when I wrote my book. We can talk. 

### If you are an asset manager and want an extra 20-40 bps per year
... through some portfolio optimization that is entirely novel and unpublished, I can provide the algorithm via API and Python tools for evaluating it easily. How sneaky is it? Very. It is a cunning cunning plan my Lord, using a cunning cunning algorithm I wrote years ago and recently repurposed. It is so very cunning it is even more devlishly cunning than unifying the two major schools of portfolio theory in a mathematical insight (I should know I'm the one who did that, see[pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05807)). I've tested this new, cunning cunning algorithm against thousands of time-series and on opinionated and unopinionated portfolios. I'm in talks to create a new index. But I can *probably* enhance your opinionated portfolios as a final step by making extremely defensive use of dependency information.   

I'm quoting a modest gain because that's on the order of likely actual long term results, probably, not an exaggerated claim. If that doesn't sound like a lot, you are not a likely customer for this and that's cool. 

### If you have questions about Crunch
Or Mid+One in particular, see [discord](https://discord.gg/NuqJTcYQ2J) and look for the midone channels. 

## Some answers to LI reach-out questions

### 1. Can I chat about Crunch?  
See above for Crunch discord we do a live AMA every Friday. 

### 2. How should I learn AI/ML/stats/math ? 
I don't have any structured guidance and can only suggest some rather bespoke opportunities to learn: 

- This time-series [project suggestion](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_timeseries-portfolios-ensembles-activity-7280960637365542912-H1hI/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

- See [lecture one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OTvuvr81R0), [lecture two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02SScMdkgY0&t=42s) and [lecture three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqYTfHe7snk) put together by the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard. That's your biology crash course. Then you'll be ready to take H&E images and predict transciptomics data. In other words, predict the result of an expensive test procedure from a cheap one. 

![](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/images/broad.png)

- Also new: a $120,000 contest to detect small departures from martingality. You'll love the [spash page](https://mid-one.crunchdao.com/) where you can play space-invaders. 

- If you are interested in generative methods there's also this long-running eleven-dimensional [game](https://github.com/microprediction/monteprediction_colab_examples/blob/main/monteprediction_entry.ipynb) I wrote to challenge you. Its a way to get familiar with Copulas and that sort of thing but you might very rapidly get to or beyond the SOTA for risk management by participating here. There is currently no prizemoney but I strongly suspect that will change soon. 
 
See [CrunchDAO.com](www.crunchdao.com) for more challenges

### 3. What should I read?
I don't know but here's a [reading list](https://github.com/microprediction/precise/blob/main/LITERATURE.md) that's pretty narrow. It's all I've got. 

### 4. Do you have any general guidance? 
Not really. Well, maybe just this: 

*Never, ever, ever kid yourself into thinking that you can determine that something mathematical or technical-but-not-arbitrary won't be useful or beneficial to try to understand*. 

Brief comment [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_ai-artificialintelligence-activity-7248460182718935040-kM_X?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on the topic.  

### 5. Are you hiring? 
Currently not but if you are good enough, you won't need a job. Create an awesome algorithm on CrunchDAO and hand it down to your grandchildren. 

### 6. Can I "learn more about your business"?
Oh boy, terrific. Best way would be to:

 - Read my [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network). 
 - Sign up at [CrunchDAO](https://www.crunchdao.com/). 
 - Go through the process of entering a contest to help advance the science of causality, say, or help detect cancer.
 - Ask questions in the discord and gain an understanding of what might help data scientists build models.
 - If you have some cool tool that is free forever that a community of quantitative people could use to assist them, by all means recommend it. 

Much appreciated!

## Questions I am unlikely to answer
You can help me by...
- Not asking me if I've considered using AI in my business. 
- Not asking me if I need consultants.
- Not replying to the link I sent you with "what is this link?".  It's a link.
- Not telling me you'd be interested in receiving an open ended essay from me on my experiences.  
- Not forcing me to very graciously decline your kind offer to discuss my org chart in great detail with a complete stranger. 
- Not reaching out to me with a pitch that begins with a declarative statement like "Firms are doing blah blah blah" or "Companies are finding that ...". This will make me want to strangle you. 
- Not offering a limited time trial of anything at all, ever. 

## ... but I could always use help!  
For example:

- Do me a solid and follow my on [X/monteprediction](https://x.com/monteprediction) because company marketting folks are wondering why I have 34k LI follows and 34 on twitter. 
- Constructive feedback on my various writings are invariably greeted warmly (see my [home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home)).
- Ah forget that. I really just want effusive unconditionally positive 5-star reviews for my [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network/dp/0262047322).
- Introductions to *active* early to mid-stage investors are appreciated
- I'm sure you're dying to write more unit tests for [midone](https://github.com/microprediction/midone) or [timemachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines) or [humpday](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday).
- Nah? Well go win lots of money [here](https://www.crunchdao.com/) instead.  
- Introductions to financial market participants whose interest might be piqued by our unique setup are appreciated. 
- Introductions to extremely good developers (solana/web3; kafka etc/streaming analytics; fx/ir/market making algo)
- I'm sure you can think of something else.
