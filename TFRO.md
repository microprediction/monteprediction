# Thanks for reaching out, stranger
This is my current "hey nice to connect on Linked-In" page. I written:

- A [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) on prediction networks. Audio for chapter one [here](https://github.com/microprediction/building_an_open_ai_network/blob/main/docs/assets/audio/Microprediction_Chapter_1.mp3).
- Free open-source software ... see [here](https://github.com/microprediction)
- Papers, articles, blogs etc are listed on my [home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home)

I will briefly list the narrow list of things I can legitimately help you with

### If you are a broker, trading venue, algo trader ...
or market data provider, or someone who needs to optimize execution. I create high quality real-time enhanced data feeds (mids and short horizon predictions) leveraging a community of 6,000 quants.

See [here](https://mid-one.crunchdao.com/)) for an example of signal crowd-sourcing.  

### If you review prediction models, or care about your own
I can help you use the world's largest stock-pile of univariate "attackers", that detect small departures from martingality. 

### If you are a central bank watcher 
See [https://pi.crunchdao.com/](https://pi.crunchdao.com/)

### If you are interested in persuing a microprediction strategy at your firm
... which is a lot easier than it was when I wrote my book. 

### If you want an extra 20-40bps per year
... through some dportfolio optimization that is entirely novel and unpublished, we can talk. I think it is sneakier than my published work unifying the two schools of portfolio theory ([pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05807)) and I've tested it against thousands of randomly chosen sub-portfolios. 

## Some answers to typical LI reach-out questions

### 1. Can I schedule a chat? 
You don't need to. If you join the Google Meet listed [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_the-regular-tuesday-night-open-mic-meeting-for-no-particular-reason-activity-7249114298583519233-Gt8V?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on any Tuesday night between 8:30pm-10:00pm EST there's an 80% chance I'll be there. I would rather commit to this than schedule deterministic interruptions to my work I usually forget.   

### 2. How should I learn AI/ML/stats/math ? 
I don't have any structured guidance and can only suggest some bespoke opportunities to learn: 

- See [lecture one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OTvuvr81R0), [lecture two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02SScMdkgY0&t=42s) and [lecture three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqYTfHe7snk) put together by the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard. That's your biology crash course. Then you'll be ready to take H&E images and predict transciptomics data. In other words, predict the result of an expensive test procedure from a cheap one.

- Also new: a $120,000 contest to detect small departures from martingality. You'll love the [spash page](https://mid-one.crunchdao.com/) where you can play space-invaders. 

- If you are interested in generative methods there's also this long-running eleven-dimensional [game](https://github.com/microprediction/monteprediction_colab_examples/blob/main/monteprediction_entry.ipynb) I wrote to challenge you. Its a way to get familiar with Copulas and that sort of thing but you might very rapidly get to or beyond the SOTA for risk management by participating here. There is currently no prizemoney but I strongly suspect that will change soon. 
 
- See [CrunchDAO.com](www.crunchdao.com) for more challenges

### Do you have any reading suggestions? 
Not really. Here's a [reading list](https://github.com/microprediction/precise/blob/main/LITERATURE.md) that's pretty narrow. 

### Do you have any general guidance? 
Not really. Maybe just this: 

Never, ever, ever kid yourself into thinking that you can determine that something mathematical or technical-but-not-arbitrary *won't* be useful or beneficial to try to understand. 

There's even a tiny bit of evidence this applies to LLMs, mentioned [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_ai-artificialintelligence-activity-7248460182718935040-kM_X?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).  

## Are you hiring? 
Currently not but if you are good enough, you won't need a job. Create an awesome algorithm on CrunchDAO and hand it down to your grandchildren. 

## I "would like to learn more about my business"
Terrific. Best way would be to:

 - Read my [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network). 
 - Sign up at [CrunchDAO](https://www.crunchdao.com/). 
 - Go through the process of entering a contest to help advance the science of causality, say, or help detect cancer.
 - Ask questions in the discord and gain an understanding of what might help data scientists build models.
 - If you have some cool tool that is free forever that a community of quantitative people could use to assist them, by all means recommend it. 

Much appreciated!

## Questions I am unlikely to answer
You can help me by...
- Not asking me if I've considered using AI in my business. 
- Not asking me if I need consultants.
- Not replying to the link I sent you with "what is this link?".  It's a link. You discover what it goes to when you click on it. (You cannot imagine how often I've got this question). 
- Not forcing me to very graciously decline your kind offer to discuss my org chart in great detail with a complete stranger. 
- Not reaching out to me with a pitch that begins with a declarative statement like "Firms are doing blah blah blah" or "Companies are finding that ...". This will make me want to strangle you. 
- Not offering a limited time trial of anything at all, ever. 

## ... but I could always use help!  
For example:

- Constructive feedback on my various writings are invariably greeted warmly (see my [home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home)).
- Ah forget that. I really just want effusive unconditionally positive 5-star reviews for my [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network/dp/0262047322).
- Introductions to *active* early to mid-stage investors are appreciated
- I'm sure you're dying to write more unit tests for [midone](https://github.com/microprediction/midone) or [timemachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines) or [humpday](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday).
- Nah? Well go win lots of money [here](https://www.crunchdao.com/) instead.  
- Introductions to financial market participants whose interest might be piqued by our unique setup are appreciated. 
- Introductions to extremely good developers (solana/web3; kafka etc/streaming analytics; fx/ir/market making algo)
- I'm sure you can think of something else.
