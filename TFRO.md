This is my current "hey nice to connect on Linked-In" page where I try to save both of us time. 

## Ways I can help you if you have twenty bucks or less

I've written:

- A [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network) that might change the way you think about artificial intelligence. 
- Free open-source software ... see [here](https://github.com/microprediction)
- Various [papers](https://github.com/microprediction/home) articles and provocations. 

If you want career advice, ask ChatGPT instead and just include my writing in your RAG. 

## Ways I can help you if you are a financial intermediary or financial market data provider, and want to upsell

- I have 6,000 data scientists including 600 PhD's around the globe who can be lazer targetted on enterprise data enhancement through a novel, layered decentralized machine whose last layer contains thousands of algorithms looking for any deviation from martingality. 
- I built the first industry scale "mid" for credit (Benchmark Solutions), algos for J.P. Morgan etc but there's a much better way now.
