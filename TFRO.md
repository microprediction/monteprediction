# Thanks for reaching out stranger
This is my current "hey nice to connect on Linked-In" page where I try to avoid repetition. It's good to connect to smart people and improve feed quality. Thanks for that. Profuse apologies if I flicked this to you absent mindedly while watching Gossip Girl with my daughter and we actually know each other! And, if we haven't talked in a while the update is that I've joined forces with Crunch per my [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_artificialintelligence-ai-forex-activity-7237212886308122624-bZLA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) 

## Stuff I've written ([home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home))

- A [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) in the category of mild AI futurism that doesn't treat the reader like an idiot. Audio for chapter one [here](https://github.com/microprediction/building_an_open_ai_network/blob/main/docs/assets/audio/Microprediction_Chapter_1.mp3).
- Free open-source software ... see [here](https://github.com/microprediction)
- Various [papers](https://github.com/microprediction/home) articles and provocations.

No warrantees! 

## If you want to chat

- [crunch discord](https://discord.gg/NuqJTcYQ2J) 
- Tuesdays 8:30pm-10:00pm EST I try to set aside a time for anyone to chat. Event invite reached via [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_the-regular-tuesday-night-open-mic-meeting-for-no-particular-reason-activity-7249114298583519233-Gt8V?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) hopefully. 


## Ways I can help you if you are a central bank watcher 
Just getting started with this one but just imagine a million generalizations of...

![](https://github.com/microprediction/monteprediction/blob/main/pi_example.png)

for every country and many other categories of document. See [https://pi.crunchdao.com/](https://pi.crunchdao.com/). 


## Ways I can help if you or your students are looking to learn "AI", ML, Math, Stats etc ...
(Insert non-tribal description of whatever it is we do with computers these days)

- See [README.md](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/README.md) and share in $100,000 in prizemoney while learning about causal discovery. This is a very intellectually engaging contest I personally enjoy a lot. Sadly I've fallen off page one of the leaderboard but you can do better. 
  
- If you are interested in generative methods there's also this long-running eleven-dimensional [game](https://github.com/microprediction/monteprediction_colab_examples/blob/main/monteprediction_entry.ipynb) I wrote to challenge you. Its a way to get familiar with Copulas and that sort of thing but you might very rapidly get to or beyond the SOTA for risk management by participating here. There is currently no prizemoney but I strongly suspect that will change soon. 
 
- See [CrunchDAO.com](www.crunchdao.com) for more challenges including a martingale and a cancer contest soon.

Some students ask me for advice on what to learn. I really just have [this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_ai-artificialintelligence-activity-7248460182718935040-kM_X?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) comment below and aside from the challenges offered here, I doubt my other advice would be terribly differentiated.   

## Ways I can help you if you are a broker, venue, or market data provider
I create extremely high quality real-time enhanced data feeds (mids etc) for algo trading, leveraging a community of 6,000 quants. 

## Ways I can help if you monitor your models 
Imagine a giant pile of univariate prediction algorithms authored by thousands of people around the world. Imagine those attacking your model residuals to try to discern any remnant signal or minor deviations from IID or martingality. I can do this for you pretty easily if you are serious. See [Ender's Game](https://github.com/microprediction/endersgame) for a sneak peek, or read this [thread](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7249114298076073984?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7249114298076073984%2C7249233969139920896%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287249233969139920896%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7249114298076073984%29). 

## Ways I can help you if you want a job
If you are good enough, you won't need one. See above.
  
- I try to dump job postings in the microprediction slack (bottom of page [here](https://www.monteprediction.com/) ).
- I shall list job opennings for my own firm here too as they arise.

It is possible that by the time you read this careers@crunchdao.com will work. 

## Ways I can help you if you want career advice 
Not sure I'm the best to ask and I don't have much that's truly differentiated on that front. Maybe just one piece of advice that is intended to be counter to some thinking I have seen in the eager yound minds of tomorrow: namely that I believe one should never, ever try to predict that something you learn *won't* be useful - or prune your search and learning for that reason. I made a comment [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_ai-artificialintelligence-activity-7248460182718935040-kM_X?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) down those lines. 

## Ways I can help you if you "would like to learn more about my business"
Terrific. Best way would be to:

 - Read my [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network). 
 - Sign up at [CrunchDAO](https://www.crunchdao.com/). 
 - Go through the process of entering a contest to help advance the science of causality, say, or help detect cancer.
 - Ask questions in the discord and gain an understanding of what might help data scientists build models.
 - If you have some cool tool that is free forever that a community of quantitative people could use to assist them, by all means recommend it. 

Much appreciated!

## Ways you can help me by not helping me 
- Not asking me if I've considered using AI in my business. 
- Not asking me if I need consultants.
- Not replying to the link I sent you with "what is this link?".  It's a link. You discover what it goes to when you click on it. (You cannot imagine how often I've got this question). 
- Not forcing me to very graciously decline your kind offer to discuss my org chart in great detail with a complete stranger.  
- Never, ever, reaching out to me with a pitch that begins with a declarative statement like "Firms are doing blah blah blah" or "Companies are finding that ...". This will make me want to strangle you. Do you marketing people really think anyone likes these lame attempts at positioning / manipulation? 
- Not offering a limited time trial of anything at all, ever. 

## Ways you can actually help me

- Constructive feedback on my various writings are invariably greeted warmly (see my [home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home)).
- Ah forget that. I really just want effusive unconditionally positive 5-star reviews for my [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network/dp/0262047322).
- Introductions to *active* early to mid-stage investors are appreciated
- I'd love it if you wrote more unit tests for [endersgame](https://github.com/microprediction/endersgame) and that might be lucrative for you. 
- Introductions to financial market participants whose interest might be piqued by our unique setup
- Introductions to extremely good developers (solana/web3; kafka etc/streaming analytics; fx/ir/market making algo)
- I'm sure you can think of something else.
