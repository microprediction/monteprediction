# Thanks for reaching out stranger

This is my current "hey nice to connect on Linked-In" page where I try to avoid repetition.  

Profuse apologies if I flicked this to you absent mindedly while watching Gossip Girl with my daughter and we actually know each other! 

It's good to connect to smart people and improve feed quality. Thanks for that. 

## Ways I can help you if you are a portfolio manager
I'm creating novel tools give portfolio managers a way to instrument the world, past and present. 

- The good news is this is potentially powerful and I can get it to your fingertips immediately. 
- The bad news is that it is potentially useless if you don't have novel economic insights or differentiated financial acumen. You need to come up with ways of looking at past events, people or connections between the same. That's your job not mine. 

If you wish to be one of the early adopters then ping me at first name dot last name at crunchdao.com 

## Ways I can help you if you have twenty bucks or less

I've written:

- A fun eleven-dimensional [game](https://github.com/microprediction/monteprediction_colab_examples/blob/main/monteprediction_entry.ipynb) you can play immediately. 
- A [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network) about AI futurism that doesn't treat the reader like an idiot. 
- Free open-source software ... see [here](https://github.com/microprediction)
- Various [papers](https://github.com/microprediction/home) articles and provocations. 

You are welcome. 

## Ways I can help you if you are a broker, venue, or market data provider
Hi if you don't know me I built the industry's first real-time "mid" for credit (Benchmark Solutions), also algos for J.P. Morgan and other things. But now...

- I work on creating extremely high quality enhanced data feeds (for market making and taking) in a very different decentralized way. 
- We have 6,000 data scientists including 600 PhD's around the globe.
- I help devise a mildly complex combinations of challenges that combine to take advantage of this diverse talent pool. The result is better and better models being promoted to production, but also better and better attacks on the same, and ongoing performance analysis, and generative models and so forth. 
- The result is incredibly hard to beat. We've proven that quality exceeds that of the most expensive private quant team every assembled (in a certain middle eastern country, you know what team I refer to).
- There are more hints at this process if you read my book backwards.  

Our "house" algorithms aren't completely shabby either and probably already better than what a few quants will build for you. However, its the use of the crowd in a granular manner that will give you the opportunity to create something truly solid and upsell derivatives of your data to all your clients for tens of thousands per month.  

## Ways I can help if you are prepared to have others inspect your own model forecast errors for residual signal. 
This makes you an unusual person btw. 

- Imagine a giant pile of univariate prediction algorithms authored by thousands of people around the world.
- Now imagine dangling you model residuals in front of them

There isn't a better way. Reach out if you're serious about using this pattern. 


## Ways I can help you if you want a job

If you are good enough, you won't need one. I'm helping construct a place where you can lodge models and they will make you money forever.  

- I created [www.monteprediction.com](https://www.monteprediction.com/) as a way for people to prove themselves.
- I also suggest [www.cruchdao.com](https://www.crunchdao.com) because unlike Kaggle it is also being hooked into legit ongoing scalable financial problems. See for example the [causality contest trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVBE5HLDUIw). 

That said:
  
- I try to dump job postings in the microprediction slack (bottom of page [here](https://www.monteprediction.com/) ).
- I shall list job opennings for my own firm here too as they arise. 

## Ways I can help you if you want career advice
Yeah I know I wouldn't want that from me either but I do get asked a lot. 

- If you want career advice from me, the best options would be my "office hours" (I will reinstate them soon) or catching me while I'm on zwift (I'm not to hard to find on the latter). 

- I have just one piece of advice that is intended to be counter to some thinking I have seen in the eager yound minds of tomorrow. I believe one should never, ever try to predict that something you learn *won't* be useful - or dimiss things for that reason. Do not be guided by what you perceive to be commercially significant. The opposite is often true, whether we are talking about choice of courses or any other way to spend your knowledge investment time. That's really the only advice I have, but there are several corollaries that will be obvious to ChatGPT. Namely, one should probably learn the key ideas from all 500 mathematical subject areas, to the extent that's possible. Same for computer science etc. Relish in the abstractness and apparent lack of utility. Because you will be wrong.    

## Ways I can help you if you want to schedule a chat 

I get a lot of people asking to chat with me and I *do* want to do that. On the other hand I have to "deep work". 

So, I am torn between being rude and not scheduling an interruptions to my work (deterministic interruptions are interruptions nonetheless), and the possibly even ruder but highly likely possibility that I completely forget a 15 minute call we set up. I politely suggest asynchronous communication via the above channels such as the Microprediction Slack, Crunch Discord, Linked-In etc. I might reinstate "office hours" soon, for anyone who wants to just chat with me while I'm on Zwift. Hmmm, if you are vey clever you could detect when I'm on Zwift and then ping me for a call. 


## Ways you can help me by not helping me 

- Not asking me if I've considered using AI in my business. 
- Not asking me if I need consultants.
- Not forcing me to very graciously decline your kind offer to discuss my org chart in great detail with a stranger.  
- Not inviting me to help you learn about my business in any other way so you can sell me crap.
- Never, ever, reaching out to me with a pitch that begins with a declarative statement like "Firms are doing blah blah blah". This will make me want to strangle you. 
- Not offering a limited time trial of anything at all, ever. 

## Ways you can actually help me

- Constructive feedback on my various writings are invariably greeted warmly [home](https://github.com/microprediction/home).
- Ah forget that. I really just want effusive unconditionally positive 5-star reviews for my [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network/dp/0262047322).
- Introductions to *active* early to mid-stage investors are appreciated
- Introductions to financial market participants whose interest might be piqued by our unique setup
- Introductions to extremely good developers (solana/web3; kafka etc/streaming analytics; fx/ir/market making algo)
- I'm sure you can think of something else. 
  
## Ways you can help me if you have capital *and are actively investing* in early-to-mid stage

Well yes, that is relevant.
