# Thanks for reaching out stranger
This is my current "hey nice to connect on Linked-In" page.

## Stuff I've written ([home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home))

- A [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/) in the category of mild AI futurism that doesn't treat the reader like an idiot. Audio for chapter one [here](https://github.com/microprediction/building_an_open_ai_network/blob/main/docs/assets/audio/Microprediction_Chapter_1.mp3).
- Free open-source software ... see [here](https://github.com/microprediction)
- Various [papers](https://github.com/microprediction/home) articles and provocations.

No warrantees! 

## If you want to chat

- See [crunch discord](https://discord.gg/NuqJTcYQ2J) 
- Tuesdays 8:30pm-10:00pm EST I try to set aside a time for anyone to chat. Event invite reached via [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_the-regular-tuesday-night-open-mic-meeting-for-no-particular-reason-activity-7249114298583519233-Gt8V?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) hopefully. 


## Ways I can help you if you are a central bank watcher 
Just getting started with this one but just imagine a million generalizations of...

![](https://github.com/microprediction/monteprediction/blob/main/pi_example.png)

for every country and many other categories of document. See [https://pi.crunchdao.com/](https://pi.crunchdao.com/). 


## If you or your students are looking to hone your "AI", ML, Math, Stats etc ...
(Insert non-tribal description of whatever it is we do with computers and mathematics these days)

- Incredible new contest just launched to save lives. See [lecture one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OTvuvr81R0), [lecture two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02SScMdkgY0&t=42s) and [lecture three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqYTfHe7snk) put together by the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard. That's your biology crash course. Then you'll be ready to take H&E images and predict transciptomics data. In other words, predict the result of an expensive test procedure from a cheap one. 

![](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/images/broad.png)

- Also new: a $120,000 contest to detect small departures from martingality. You'll love the [spash page](https://mid-one.crunchdao.com/) where you can play space-invaders. 

  
- If you are interested in generative methods there's also this long-running eleven-dimensional [game](https://github.com/microprediction/monteprediction_colab_examples/blob/main/monteprediction_entry.ipynb) I wrote to challenge you. Its a way to get familiar with Copulas and that sort of thing but you might very rapidly get to or beyond the SOTA for risk management by participating here. There is currently no prizemoney but I strongly suspect that will change soon.

## If you are looking for general guidance
Some students ask me for very general advice on what to learn or what do do with their career, but they invariably ignore the first piece of advice I give them so I'm left thinking hmmm, should I offer more advice that will also be ignored?

Would you also like to dismiss the one tiny morsel of guidance I have any confidence in that is not completely platitudinous? Well here it is, the advice is to never, ever attempt to determine that something mathematical or technical *won't* be useful and is not worth your time to learn. 

Brief rationale: you *don't* know how your brain works. You don't know how the world works. You probably underestimate the power of abstraction and high level analogies. Moreover there is copious science suggesting that pruning learning consciously or though laziness will materially impact your long term potential. 

That's all I've got. See [this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_ai-artificialintelligence-activity-7248460182718935040-kM_X?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) comment if you wish.  

## If you are looking for reading recommendations
I don't mind sharing my personal reading list on robust portfolio and ensembling literature [here](https://github.com/microprediction/precise/blob/main/LITERATURE.md), but it is what is is. 

## Ways I can help you if you are a broker, venue, or market data provider
I create extremely high quality real-time enhanced data feeds (mids etc) for algo trading, leveraging a community of 6,000 quants.

## Ways I can help if you monitor your models 
I can help you with the world's largest stock-pile of univariate "attackers" that detect small departures from martingality. 

## Ways I can help you if you want a job
If you are good enough, you won't need one. Create an awesome algorithm on CrunchDAO and hand it down to your grandchildren. 
  
- I try to dump job postings in the microprediction slack (bottom of page [here](https://www.monteprediction.com/) ).
- I shall list job opennings for my own firm here too as they arise.

It is possible that by the time you read this careers@crunchdao.com will work. 



## Ways you can help me by not helping me 
- Not asking me if I've considered using AI in my business. 
- Not asking me if I need consultants.
- Not replying to the link I sent you with "what is this link?".  It's a link. You discover what it goes to when you click on it. (You cannot imagine how often I've got this question). 
- Not forcing me to very graciously decline your kind offer to discuss my org chart in great detail with a complete stranger.  
- Never, ever, reaching out to me with a pitch that begins with a declarative statement like "Firms are doing blah blah blah" or "Companies are finding that ...". This will make me want to strangle you. Do you marketing people really think anyone likes these lame attempts at positioning / manipulation? 
- Not offering a limited time trial of anything at all, ever. 

## Ways I can help you if you "would like to learn more about my business"
Terrific. Best way would be to:

 - Read my [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network). 
 - Sign up at [CrunchDAO](https://www.crunchdao.com/). 
 - Go through the process of entering a contest to help advance the science of causality, say, or help detect cancer.
 - Ask questions in the discord and gain an understanding of what might help data scientists build models.
 - If you have some cool tool that is free forever that a community of quantitative people could use to assist them, by all means recommend it. 

Much appreciated!

## Ways you can actually help me

- Constructive feedback on my various writings are invariably greeted warmly (see my [home page](https://github.com/microprediction/home)).
- Ah forget that. I really just want effusive unconditionally positive 5-star reviews for my [book](https://www.amazon.com/Microprediction-Building-Open-AI-Network/dp/0262047322).
- Introductions to *active* early to mid-stage investors are appreciated
- I'm sure you're dying to write more unit tests for [midone](https://github.com/microprediction/midone) or [timemachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines) or [humpday](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday).
- Nah? Well go win lots of money [here](https://www.crunchdao.com/) instead.  
- Introductions to financial market participants whose interest might be piqued by our unique setup are appreciated. 
- Introductions to extremely good developers (solana/web3; kafka etc/streaming analytics; fx/ir/market making algo)
- I'm sure you can think of something else.

Be quick and DM me.
